	<h1>Failed Poscast Ep.1</h1>
	<p>     The concept of my piece was the idea that Norton ( my character ) had a podcast that isn’t going so well. I was inspired by Joe Rogan’s podcast and thought that portraying  my character trying to make a podcast would be interesting. I combined a total of five audio samples along with one that I recorded to be Norton and his first guest. I used effects to change the voices of the audio I recorded because I wanted them to have a cartoonish like vibe. At first the most challenging part of the project was finding not just one but many tracks to combine along with mine. I overcame that challenge when I wrote the script for the podcast portion and wrote it so it would include multiple tracks. I had my story center around the fact that he would display other music. </p>
