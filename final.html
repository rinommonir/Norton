	<h1>The End of the Road</h1>
	<p>For my final project I was inspired by a show called Regular show on Cartoon Network. I was only inspired on the basis of making it silly and fun, the rest is my own imagination. I thought the idea of how random it is would make it funny and goofy. I chose to do an animation short/music video combination because that helped me convey my vision . My video basically is a silly representation of someone(Norton) getting hit then afterwards they start crying, the attacker then starts crying as well. It ends with just two people crying side by side with each other. There is nothing else to the story of it, itâ€™s something simple and something I thought would be funny. I used stop motion animation with my hand drawn drawings. The app that we learned to use in class that dealt with stop motion.For audio I used Audacity to make a peaceful sound followed by catholic yelling. My storyboard idea was changed a bit, because originally I did not have both characters cry at the end. Originally It was just my character Norton who gets beat up the whole time, but when completing my project the ending had changed. Ultimately I am satisfied with my project and happy with the outcome. </p>
